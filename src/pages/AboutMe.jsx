      <p>Hello! I’m Ryan Alcada, an IT student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology/Cybersecurity at Kean University, where I am honing my skills in areas such as networking, cybersecurity, web development, and IT support.</p>

      <p>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed a solid understanding of various IT concepts and technologies, including troubleshooting, system administration, and cloud computing. My coursework has given me hands-on experience with programming languages such as JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS, while also introducing me to network configurations, database management, and IT infrastructure.</p>

      <p>I’m eager to apply my skills in a professional environment, where I can grow and contribute to a team. I’m particularly interested in roles that allow me to leverage my problem-solving abilities and technical knowledge to support businesses in solving real-world technical challenges. My goal is to gain practical experience that will help me build a long-term career in IT.</p>
